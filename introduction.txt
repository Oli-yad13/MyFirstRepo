# Brief Introduction About Myself
Hi, I'm Oliyad Bekele, a passionate software engineering student with a strong interest in building real-world tech solutions. I enjoy turning ideas into code, especially when it comes to projects that blend technology with social impact. I'm self-taught in many areas, always curious, and constantly pushing myself to grow. Whether it's developing apps, working with databases, or exploring how software can support agriculture and healthcare, I bring focus, creativity, and a deep drive to learn and build.
